The Journey of Your HTTPS Request to Google
Ever wondered what happens in the background when you type https://www.google.com into your web browser and press Enter? From the moment you initiate the request until you see the Google homepage, your request goes through a fascinating series of steps. Here, we'll demystify this process and provide a visual representation of the entire journey.

1. DNS Resolution
Your browser asks a DNS server for the IP address associated with www.google.com. This is like asking for directions to a destination.
2. Establishing a Secure Connection
The browser initiates a TCP/IP connection to the Google server's IP on port 443, the default port for HTTPS traffic.
3. Encryption via HTTPS/SSL
As part of establishing a secure connection, the SSL/TLS handshake occurs. This ensures that the data sent and received is encrypted.
4. Passing Through Firewalls
The request, now secure, passes through firewalls designed to protect against unauthorized access.
5. Load Balancing
Google's infrastructure uses load balancers to distribute network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring efficiency and reliability.
6. Web Server Response
The web server receives the request and serves the appropriate web page. It's like a librarian fetching a book for you.
7. Application Server Processing
The application server generates the requested web page, which may include executing backend code or retrieving user data.
8. Database Interaction
If necessary, the application server retrieves data from a database to dynamically generate the web page content.
