Networking Basics #0

## Overview
This project aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of networking, including an understanding of the OSI model, different types of networks (LAN, WAN, and the Internet), and the basics of TCP/UDP and IP/ICMP protocols. It's designed to lay the groundwork for more advanced networking topics and practical network management.

## Objectives
- Understand the OSI model and its 7 layers
- Distinguish between LAN, WAN, and Internet connections
- Explore the Transport layer with a focus on TCP and UDP protocols
- Learn about the Network layer, emphasizing IP and ICMP

## Files
- `0-OSI_model`: A script that explains the OSI model, focusing on the Transport and Network layers, and the significance of TCP/UDP and IP/ICMP protocols.
- `1-types_of_network`: A text file containing answers to questions about different types of networks, such as LAN, WAN, and the Internet, and their applications.

## Usage
Each file in this project serves as a foundational piece to understanding networking basics. The `0-OSI_model` can be read to get a conceptual grasp of how different layers of the OSI model function, particularly focusing on the transport and network layers. The `1-types_of_network` file contains specific examples of network types to help differentiate between LAN, WAN, and Internet connections in practical scenarios.
